## Hi, I'm Valentin Calomino. 
### I'm a computer engineering student in Universidad de Buenos Aires and a self-taught Backend Dev.
I'm interested mainly in Java, since it's a robust language that I started learning a few months ago. I also find Golang intriguing and I'd be willing to check it out in the future.
I have some knowledge on JavaScript, NodeJs and React also. Feel free to contact me with a job opportunity for any of those languages.

In the present I'm currently improving my Java programming skills. I'm learning how to implement authentication and testing to my Spring Boot apps. In the near future I'll be focusing a little bit more in learning docker, microservices architecture
and design patterns related.

To reach me feel free to send an email to: vrcalomino@gmail.com
